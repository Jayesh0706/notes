# 1) **Trivy tool**

#### Trivy is a comprehensive and versatile open-source vulnerability scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities in container images, Kubernetes deployments, and code repositories

## Key Features:

1. **Container Image Scanning**: Trivy scans container images for vulnerabilities in both OS packages and application dependencies.
2. **Kubernetes Deployment Scanning**: Trivy scans Kubernetes deployments for vulnerabilities in container images, configuration files, and infrastructure as code (IaC).
3. **Support for Multiple Formats**: Trivy supports scanning for various formats, including Docker images, tar archives, Podman, and Git repositories.
4.  **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Trivy can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines using binary installations and Helm charts.(Add in CI/CD project )

## Command-Line Interface:

Trivy provides a command-line interface (CLI) for scanning and reporting vulnerabilities. Some common commands include:

- `trivy image <image_name>`: Scans a container image for vulnerabilities.
- `trivy kubectl <pod/deployment_name>`: Scans a Kubernetes pod or deployment for vulnerabilities.
- `trivy fs <directory>`: Scans a local filesystem directory for vulnerabilities.
- `trivy repo <repository_url>`: Scans a code repository for vulnerabilities.





# 2) **Kyverno**
#### The Kyverno project provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage the complete Policy-as-Code (PaC) lifecycle for Kubernetes and other cloud native environments

1) Kyverno policies are declarative YAML resources and **no new language** is required.
2) Automate Pod Security Enforcement:    
   A Kyverno policy written for Pods applies automatically to all known Kubernetes Pod controllers, helping you automatically enforce policies on Deployments and StatefulSets.
3) Admission Controller
   Don’t just detect insecure configurations. With Kyverno you can proactively block and prevent them.
4) **Resource Validation**
- Validate Kubernetes resource definitions using custom rules (e.g., ensure labels, annotations, or naming conventions are present and valid).
- Prevent misconfigured or dangerous resource configurations (e.g., disallow `imagePullPolicy: Always`).




# 3) **KubeLinter**
### KubeLinter analyzes Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts, and checks them against a variety of best practices, with a focus on production readiness and security.

1) This is to help teams check early and often for security misconfigurations and DevOps best practices.
2) Some common examples of these include running containers as a non-root user, enforcing least privilege, and storing sensitive information only in secrets.
3) KubeLinter is configurable, so you can enable and disable checks, as well as create your own custom checks, depending on the policies you want to follow within your organization.


# 4)**Kube Bench**
### Kube-bench is an open-source tool developed by Aqua Security that helps assess the security of Kubernetes clusters by running checks against the ==Center for Internet Security (CIS)== Kubernetes benchmark

1) kube-bench is a tool that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/).
2) 1. It is impossible to inspect the master nodes of managed clusters, e.g. ==GKE, EKS, AKS and ACK==, using kube-bench as one does not have access to such nodes, although it is still possible to use kube-bench ==to check worker node configuration in these environments==.
